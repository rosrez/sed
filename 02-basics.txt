1. THE 'SUBSTITUTE' COMMAND

In its most basic form, the command looks like this:

s/old/new/

'old' is a text to replace with 'new'.

EXAMPLE

sed 's/the/THE/' dukeofyork.txt 


The grand old Duke of York
^^^
Mixed small letters and a capital, not caught by the command

He had ten thousand men
He marched THEm up to the top of the hill
                                 ^^^
                                 Second occurrence not caught, global modifier is not specified.
And he marched THEm down again
And when THEy were up they were up
And when THEy were down they were down
And when THEy were only half-way up
They were neiTHEr up nor down

2. THE GLOBAL MODIFIER

Affects every occurrence of a pattern in a string.

3. REFERENCING THE Nth OCCURRENCE

sed 's/the/THE/2' dukeofyork.txt

The /2 modifier at the end of the substitute command tells sed to replace only the second match within a line.
