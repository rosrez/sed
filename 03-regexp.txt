6. AMPERSAND & - REFERS TO A MATCH IN A REPLACEMENT STRING

We can refer to the match we've just found and are about to replace with an ampersand. For example, here we put every capitalized word in a text in parentheses:

$ sed 's/[A-Z][a-z]*/(&)/g' dukeofyork.txt 
                      ^--- OUR MATCH, WE SURROUND IT WITH PARENTHESES HERE

(The) grand old (Duke) of (York)
(He) had ten thousand men
(He) marched them up to the top of the hill
(And) he marched them down again
(And) when they were up they were up
(And) when they were down they were down
(And) when they were only half-way up

Capture groups are marked with parentheses in the search pattern, and parentheses must be escaped, hence the \(pattern\) syntax.

He marched <them> <up> to the top of the hill
