       ^---- OUR COMMAND WORKS FOR LINE 3 ONLY.

The grand old Duke of York
He had ten thousand men
He marched them UP to the top of the hill <--- THE ONLY LINE THAT'S CHANGED
And he marched them down again
And when they were up they were up
And when they were down they were down
And when they were only half-way up
They were neither up nor down
