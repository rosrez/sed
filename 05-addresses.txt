1. LINE NUMBERS

$ sed '3s/up/UP/' dukeofyork.txt 
       ^---- OUR COMMAND WORKS FOR LINE 3 ONLY.

The grand old Duke of York
He had ten thousand men
He marched them UP to the top of the hill <--- THE ONLY LINE THAT'S CHANGED
And he marched them down again
And when they were up they were up
And when they were down they were down
And when they were only half-way up
They were neither up nor down

2. ADDRESS CAN BE A REGULAR EXPRESSION

EXAMPLE:

$ sed -n '/down/p' dukeofyork.txt 
And he marched them down again
And when they were down they were down
They were neither up nor down

Only lines that contain 'down' are printed.

3. WE CAN SPECIFY PATTERN RANGES AS ADDRESSES FOR COMMANDS

$ nl dukeofyork.txt 
     1  The grand old Duke of York
     2  He had ten thousand men
     3  He marched them up to the top of the hill
     4  And he marched them down again
     5  And when they were up they were up
     6  And when they were down they were down
     7  And when they were only half-way up
     8  They were neither up nor down

$ nl dukeofyork.txt | sed -n '/marched/,/when/p'
     3  He marched them up to the top of the hill    <---- FIRST OCCURRENCE OF 1st EXPRESSION
     4  And he marched them down again
     5  And when they were up they were up           <---- FIRST OCCURRENCE OF 2nd PATTERN AFTER THE FIRST

NOTE: if both patterns match on the same line, the second pattern is ignored and the command is repeated until another match of the 2nd pattern is found or sed runs out of file:

$ nl dukeofyork.txt | sed -n '/hill/,/up/p'
     3  He marched them up to the top of the hill    <--- 'up' is ignored here
     4  And he marched them down again
     5  And when they were up they were up           <--- the search for the 2nd pattern (and printing) continues until this line

4. WE CAN MIX LINE NUMBERS AND REGULAR EXPRESSION

nl dukeofyork.txt | sed -n '2,/down/p'
     2  He had ten thousand men
     3  He marched them up to the top of the hill
     4  And he marched them down again

This starts printing at line 2 and continues until 'down' is found.

5. NEGATING AN ADDRESS - THE EXCLAMATION MARK !

This prints lines 2 to 5 of the sample file:

$ nl dukeofyork.txt | sed -n '2,5p'
     2  He had ten thousand men
     3  He marched them up to the top of the hill
     4  And he marched them down again
     5  And when they were up they were up

And this prints lines of the sample file outside the range 2,5:

$ nl dukeofyork.txt | sed -n '2,5!p'
                                 ^ -- EXCLAMATION MARK, REVERSES THE SENSE OF AN ADDRESS

     1  The grand old Duke of York
     6  And when they were down they were down
     7  And when they were only half-way up
     8  They were neither up nor down
