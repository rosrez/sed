1. The 'd' (delete) command may be combined with address ranges, just as the 'p' (print) command can.

EXAMPLE 1 - DELETE A SPECIFIC LINE NUMBER (NUMBERS)

$ nl dukeofyork.txt | sed '4d'
     1  The grand old Duke of York
     2  He had ten thousand men
     3  He marched them up to the top of the hill
     5  And when they were up they were up
     6  And when they were down they were down
     7  And when they were only half-way up
     8  They were neither up nor down

This deletes the 4th line.

EXAMPLE 2 - A RANGE OF PATTERNS

$ nl dukeofyork.txt | sed '/thousand/,/down/d'
     1  The grand old Duke of York
     5  And when they were up they were up
     6  And when they were down they were down
     7  And when they were only half-way up
     8  They were neither up nor down

This deletes everything between the pattern 'thousand' and 'down', inclusive.

2. DELETE AND THE EXCLAMATION POINT MODIFIER

The delete command is often used with the exclamation mark modifier.

$ nl dukeofyork.txt | sed '/up/d'
     1  The grand old Duke of York
     2  He had ten thousand men
     4  And he marched them down again
     6  And when they were down they were down

$ nl dukeofyork.txt | sed '2,4!d'
     2  He had ten thousand men
     3  He marched them up to the top of the hill
     4  And he marched them down again
