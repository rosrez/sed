1. 'y' COMMAND - CHARACTER TO CHARACTER REPLACEMENT.

The command is similar to the UNIX 'tr' command. The command takes two strings:

y/12345/67890/

12345 - if input contains one of the characters in the first string (1,2,3,4 or 5 in our case), the matching character is replaced with the character at the same position from the second string (sed replaces 1 with 6, 2 with 7, and so on).

2. IMPOSSIBLE TO SUBSTITUTE CHARACTER RANGES.

3. SPECIAL CHARACTERS

We can substitute input with special characters like \n, etc.
