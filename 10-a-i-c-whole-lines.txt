1. 'a' COMMAND

The line expects
<--- The backslash escapes the newline character (there must be no characters between / and the newline)

EXAMPLE 1 - INSERT A LINE AFTER THE WORD 'down'

$ sed '/down/ a\
> ==> HAHA HE SAID "DOWN"    <---- This newline marks a newline, this final newline need not be escaped
>  ' dukeofyork.txt         


The grand old Duke of York
He had ten thousand men
He marched them up to the top of the hill
And he marched them down again
==> HAHA HE SAID "DOWN"
And when they were up they were up
And when they were down they were down
==> HAHA HE SAID "DOWN"
And when they were only half-way up
They were neither up nor down
==> HAHA HE SAID "DOWN"

-------------------

EXAMPLE 2 - INSERT TWO LINES AFTER THE WORD 'down'

Again, we escape the newline after the a command, but also the subsequent line. Only the final newline need not be escaped.

$ sed '/down/ a\
> ==> HAHA\
> ==> HE SAID "DOWN"
> ' dukeofyork.txt
The grand old Duke of York
He had ten thousand men
He marched them up to the top of the hill
And he marched them down again
==> HAHA
==> HE SAID "DOWN"
And when they were up they were up
And when they were down they were down
==> HAHA
==> HE SAID "DOWN"
And when they were only half-way up
They were neither up nor down
==> HAHA
==> HE SAID "DOWN"

EXAMPLE 3 - APPEND A BLANK LINE AFTER EVERY LINE IN A FILE

$ sed 'a\
> ' dukeofyork.txt
The grand old Duke of York

He had ten thousand men

He marched them up to the top of the hill

And he marched them down again

And when they were up they were up

And when they were down they were down

And when they were only half-way up

They were neither up nor down

2. 'i' - INSERT (BEFORE A MATCH)

'i' is exactly the same as 'a', except it inserts a line before the matching line.

EXAMPLE:

$ cat i-command.sed 
/again/ i\
==> HE'S ABOUT TO SAY "AGAIN"
/again/ a\
==> HE SAID "AGAIN"

<EOF>

$ sed -f i-command.sed dukeofyork.txt 
The grand old Duke of York
He had ten thousand men
He marched them up to the top of the hill
==> HE'S ABOUT TO SAY "AGAIN"                   <--- THE RESULT OF THE 'i' COMMAND
And he marched them down again
==> HE SAID "AGAIN"                             <--- THE RESULT OF THE 'a' COMMAND
And when they were up they were up
And when they were down they were down
And when they were only half-way up
They were neither up nor down

3. 'c' - CHANGE LINE(S) 

This command can accept a range. This line replaces a line or a range of lines with new text.

$ sed '/top/,/again/ c\
> He treated them inconsistently\
> And their moods were variable
> ' dukeofyork.txt
The grand old Duke of York
He had ten thousand men
He treated them inconsistently            <--- NEW TEXT
And their moods were variable             <--- NEW TEXT
And when they were up they were up
And when they were down they were down
And when they were only half-way up
They were neither up nor down
