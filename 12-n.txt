1. 'n' COMMAND - PRINT A LINE AND GET THE NEXT LINE

The command prints the current line, including any modifications made to it by previous commands, and gets the next line.

Combined with the sed flag -n, the command just gets the next line. This is most useful in sed scripts with command blocks. Commands in a block are executed in order, and only after that a line is printed. The 'n' command can be used within a block to perform commands on lines AFTER A GIVEN ADDRESS.

EXAMPLE
This script encloses two lines following a line that contains 'marched' in double parentheses.

$ cat braces-after-marched.sed 
/marched/ {
    n           # print the current line (containing 'marched') and advance to the next line
    s/^/((/     # replace the beginning of line with ((
    n           # print the previous (modified) line and advance to the next one
    s/$/))/     # replace the end of line with ))
}

ed -f n.sed dukeofyork.txt 
The grand old Duke of York
He had ten thousand men
He marched them up to the top of the hill
((And he marched them down again            <-- THIS LINE ALSO CONTAINS 'marched', but the 'n' command ate it up.
And when they were up they were up))
And when they were down they were down
And when they were only half-way up
They were neither up nor down

The second line with the word 'marched' was processed by the n command so it was no longer part of the matching.
