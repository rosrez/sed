1. THE 'q' COMMAND - QUIT PROCESSING IF A CONDITION IS MET

The command prints the current line and sed then quits further processing immediately.

EXAMPLE 1

$ sed '/again/q' dukeofyork.txt 
The grand old Duke of York
He had ten thousand men
He marched them up to the top of the hill
And he marched them down again

EXAMPLE 2

Do a complex replacement (see section 11) and quit.

$ cat braces-after-marched-and-quit.sed 
/marched/ {
    n
    s/^/((/
    n
    s/$/))/
    q
}

$ sed -f braces-after-marched-and-quit.sed dukeofyork.txt 
The grand old Duke of York
He had ten thousand men
He marched them up to the top of the hill
((And he marched them down again        <--- REPLACED LINE AFTER THE MATCH
And when they were up they were up))    <--- REPLACED LINE AFTER THE MATCH
