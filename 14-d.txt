1. 'd' COMMAND - ABORT PROCESSING FOR THE CURRENT LINE

EXAMPLE

$ cat d.sed 
/up/ {
    s/up/UP/
    d
    s/^/==/
}

This script simply deletes any lines containing 'up'. The reason is that after the first substitution, the line gets deleted and the second substitution (and subsequent printing) never takes place.
