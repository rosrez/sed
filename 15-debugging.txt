3. l - PRINTS THE LINE NUMBER, A $ CHARACTER AT THE END, AND ANY NON-PRINTING CHARACTERS ARE REPLACED WITH ESCAPE SEQUENCES

EXAMPLE

Suppose we have a script that changes the 3rd space in a line to a tab. The script looks like this:

$ cat space-to-tab.sed 
# Replaces the 3rd space in a line to a tab

s/ /    /3

If we run it on our file, we get this output:

$ sed -f space-to-tab.sed dukeofyork.txt 
The grand old   Duke of York
He had ten  thousand men
He marched them up to the top of the hill  <--- WE DON'T SEE EXACTLY WHERE THE TAB WENT
And he marched  them down again
And when they   were up they were up
And when they   were down they were down
And when they   were only half-way up
They were neither   up nor down

If we add the l command after the s command, like so:

$ cat space-to-tab.sed 
# Replaces the 3rd space in a line to a tab

s/ /    /3
l

we get this:

$ sed -f space-to-tab.sed dukeofyork.txt

You can also suppress the default output with the -n argument to sed:

$ sed -nf space-to-tab.sed dukeofyork.txt 
The grand old\tDuke of York$
He had ten\tthousand men$
He marched them\tup to the top of the hill$
And he marched\tthem down again$

And when they\twere only half-way up$
