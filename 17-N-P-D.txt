1. THE 'N' COMMAND

The command reads the next line into the pattern space.

EXAMPLE. 

On lines containing 'marched', read the next line and append it to the pattern space
(now there are two lines in the pattern space) and replace the newline with ' - '.

marched/ {
    N
    s/\n/ - /
}

The result is:

$ sed -f replace-newline-after-marched.sed dukeofyork.txt 
The grand old Duke of York
He had ten thousand men
He marched them up to the top of the hill - And he marched them down again
And when they were up they were up
And when they were down they were down
And when they were only half-way up
They were neither up nor down

NOTE that after N takes effect in this example, the pattern space looks like this:

He marched them up to the top of the hill\nAnd he marched them down again
                                         ^^   --- ONE NEWLINE

This newline character is replaced by the subsequent s command.

@@
2. THE 'P' COMMAND.

The command prints the contents of the pattern space up to the first newline.

@@
3. THE 'D' COMMAND.

The command deletes the contents of the pattern space up to the first newline.

EXAMPLE.

Create a script that replaces a sequence marched (words) up with marched...up,
even if the sequence spans two lines.

ATTEMPT 1.

$ cat replace-marched-up-naive.sed 
# read the next line
N
# replace with shorter version
s/marched.*up/marched...up/

$ sed -f replace-marched-up-naive.sed dukeofyork.txt 
The grand old Duke of York
He had ten thousand men
He marched...up to the top of the hill      <--- SINGLE LINE MATCH WORKS AS EXPECTED
And he marched them down again              <--- THIS HAS BEEN EATEN BY THE 'N' COMMAND SO IT ISN'T MATCHED FOR PATTERN
And when they were up they were up
And when they were down they were down
And when they were only half-way up
They were neither up nor down

ATTEMPT 2.

$ cat replace-marched-up.sed 
# Grab the next line
N
# replace (possibly a multiline pattern match) with marched...up.
s/marched.*up/marched...up/
# print the first line of the pattern space
P
# delete the first line of the pattern space:
D

This script works as expected:

$ sed -f replace-marched-up.sed dukeofyork.txt 
The grand old Duke of York
He had ten thousand men
He marched...up to the top of the hill
And he marched...up
And when they were down they were down
And when they were only half-way up
They were neither up nor down

This is how this works.

1) First occurrence of 'marched':

He marched them up to the top of the hill

2) N - append the next line, pattern space is now:

He marched them up to the top of the hill\nAnd he marched them down again

3) Replaced the FIRST match in the pattern space:

He marched< them >up to the top of the hill\nAnd he marched them down again

4) Print/Delete the first line from the pattern space, the pattern space is:

And he marched them down again

5) Check for match - TRUE

6) Get the next line, the pattern space now is

And he marched them down again\nAnd when they were up they were up

7) Replace the pattern:

And he marched< them down again\nAnd when they were up they were >up

8) Print the first (and only, this time) line and delete the first line.

9) The pattern space is now empty and we proceed normally to the next line.
